From this analysis, we can see some key changes like: 

1. East Asia and Pacific increased drastically on their carbon emission reaching the highest 
of the region in 1997 and continuing to increase till around 13M in 2007

2. Between the period of 1987 - 1997, Europe and Central Asia had the highest spike in data 
from around 2.5M to 7.5M but it lowered and remained somewhat constant at between 6M and 7M
